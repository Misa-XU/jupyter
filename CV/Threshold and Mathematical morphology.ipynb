    "## Ordered Sets\n",
    "A (non-strict) partial order is a __binary relation__ $\\le$ over a set P satisfying particular axioms which are discussed below. When $a ≤ b$, we say that a is related to b. (This does not imply that b is also related to a, because the relation need not be symmetric.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The axioms for a non-strict partial order state that the relation $≤$ is __reflexive__, __antisymmetric__, and __transitive__. That is, $\\forall a, b, c \\in P$, it must satisfy:\n",
    "- $a ≤ a$ (reflexivity: every element is related to itself).\n",
    "- if $a ≤ b$ and $b ≤ a$, then a = b (antisymmetry: two distinct elements cannot be related in both directions).\n",
    "- if $a ≤ b$ and $b ≤ c$, then $a ≤ c$ (transitivity: if a first element is related to a second element, and, in turn, that element is related to a third element, then the first element is related to the third element).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a, b from a partially ordered set P, if $a ≤ b$ or $b ≤ a$, then a and b are __comparable__. Otherwise they are __incomparable__. For example, {x} and {x,y,z} are comparable, while {x} and {y} are not. A partial order under which every pair of elements is comparable is called a __total order__ or __linear order__; a totally ordered set is also called a __chain__. A subset of a poset in which no two distinct elements are comparable is called an antichain (e.g. the set of singletons {{x}, {y}, {z}}). An element a is said to be __strictly less__ than an element b if $a ≤ b$ and $a≠b$. An element a is said to be __covered__ by another element b, written a<:b, if a is strictly less than b and no third element c fits between them.\n",

A set may have many upper bounds, or none at all. An upper bound u of S is said to be its __least upper bound__, or __join__, or __supremum__, if $u ≤ x$ for each upper bound $x$ of $S$. A set need not have a __least upper bound__, but it cannot have more than one. \n",

A lower bound l of S is said to be its __greatest lower bound__, or __meet__, or __infimum__, if x ≤ l for each lower bound x of S. A set may have many lower bounds, or none at all, but can have at most one greatest lower bound.\n",

    "A partially ordered set (L, ≤) is called a __join-semilattice__ if each two-element subset {a, b} ⊆ L has a __join__, and is called a __meet-semilattice__ if each two-element subset has a meet, denoted by $a ∨ b$ and $a ∧ b$ respectively. $(L, ≤)$ is called a __lattice__ if it is both a join- and a meet-semilattice. This definition makes ∨ and ∧ binary operations. Both operations are monotone with respect to the order: $a1 ≤ a2$ and $b1 ≤ b2$ implies that $a1 ∨ b1 ≤ a2 ∨ b2$ and $a1 ∧ b1$ ≤ $a2 ∧ b2$.\n",
