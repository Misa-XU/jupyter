    "# 1. Extreme Values\n",
    "Recall the single variable case, $f(x)$ has a local maximum (or local minimum) value at a point $a$ in its domain if $f(x) \\le f(a)$ or $f(x) \\ge f(a)$ for all $x$ in the domain of f and be sufficient close to $a$. If the inequalities holds for all x in the domain of $f$, we then we say that $f(x)$ is a global maximum (or global minimum) value at point $a$.\n",
    "### 1.1 Necessary conditions of extreme values\n",
    "Moreover, the extreme values will occure only at points that in the following three conditions:\n",
    "1. It's a critical point where $\\nabla f = \\mathbf{0}$\n",
    "2. It's a singular point where $\\nabla f$ doesn't exist\n",
    "3. It's a boundary point of the domain of f\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Sufficient conditions of extreme values\n",
    "If f is a _continuous_ function of $n$ variables whose domain is a __closed__ and __bounded__ set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, then the range of $f$ is a bounded set of real values; And the function $f$ have both maximum and minimum in its domain.\n",

    "#### 1.3.2 Second Derivative Test\n",
    "Suppose that all points near $\\mathbf{a}$ have _continuous_ second partial derivatives, Then the __Hessian__ is also continuous.\n",
    "1. if $\\mathscr H$ is positive definite, then it's a local minima\n",
    "2. if $\\mathscr H$ is negative definite, then it's a local maxima.\n",
    "3. if $\\mathscr H$ is indefinite, then it's a saddle point.\n",
    "4. if $\\mathscr H$ is none of the above, then the test gives no information\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the second order taylor expansion of $f(\\mathbf{x})$. Since $\\Delta f(\\mathbf x) = 0$, then $f(\\mathbf{x + t}) - f(\\mathbf x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf t^T H(\\mathbf x + \\theta \\mathbf h) \\mathbf t$"
